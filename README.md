Notes to self:

2 public folders due to:
    Firebase public/ → Hosts the website when deployed via Firebase Hosting.
    React public/ → Used during development for static assets (like the default "vite.svg").

"src" folder is kept and not renamed due to:
    When running "npm run dev", Vite compiles src/ into a working React app.

Use "tree /F > structure.txt" to save a file structure map!
